## About this edition.

This git edition is based on the scanned 1909 edition and mechanically checked against a commercial copy of the text from CDROM. Differences were corrected against the paper edition. The text itself is thus a highly accurate rendition. The footnotes were entered manually.

This text is in the PUBLIC DOMAIN, released September 1993.
